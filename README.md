# CBAT: Committee Bias Analysis Tool
Project developed for the Bachelor's degree thesis titled "Tool to search for a systemic bias in bibliography linked to the composition of the program committee of scientific conferences".

## Abstract
The peer review process of research articles is a key part of academic publishing; its abuse for the purpose of personal return may affect the admission of the papers presented at scientific conferences. The aim of this thesis is the construction of a tool for the collection of bibliometric data useful for analysis aimed at finding systemic bias due to the composition of the scientific conference commission. The proposed implementation uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extrapolation of information and recognition of the entities present in the Call For Papers of major international academic events.
